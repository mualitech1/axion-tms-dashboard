src/pages/jobs/           - Updated for new routing patterns
src/loaders/jobLoader.ts  - Professional data loading
src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx - Error boundaries
```

### **The Miracle Moment:**
```
Master Saif: "Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar! 
              It worked even the job details page loaded successfully!
